Of course, in a normal web server, there may be many\nopen connections, and it is not reasonable to abruptly shut those down\nbecause an error was triggered by someone else.</p>\n<p>The better approach is to send an error response to the request that\ntriggered the error, while letting the others finish in their normal\ntime, and stop listening for new requests in that worker.</p>\n<p>In this way, <code>domain</code> usage goes hand-in-hand with the cluster module,\nsince the master process can fork a new worker when a worker\nencounters an error.  For Node.js programs that scale to multiple\nmachines, the terminating proxy or service registry can take note of\nthe failure, and react accordingly.</p>\n<p>For example, this is not a good idea:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">// XXX WARNING!  BAD IDEA!\n\nconst d = require(&#39;domain&#39;).create();\nd.on(&#39;error&#39;, (er) =&gt; {\n  // The error won&#39;t crash the process, but what it does is worse!\n  // Though we&#39;ve prevented abrupt process restarting, we are leaking\n  // resources like crazy if this ever happens.\n  // This is no better than process.on(&#39;uncaughtException&#39;)!\n  console.log(`error, but oh well ${er.message}`);\n});\nd.run(() =&gt; {\n  require(&#39;http&#39;).createServer((req, res) =&gt; {\n    handleRequest(req, res);\n  }).listen(PORT);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>By using the context of a domain, and the resilience of separating our\nprogram into multiple worker processes, we can react more\nappropriately, and handle errors with much greater safety.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">// Much better!\n\nconst cluster = require(&#39;cluster&#39;);\nconst PORT = +process.env.PORT || 1337;\n\nif (cluster.isMaster) {\n  // A more realistic scenario would have more than 2 workers,\n  // and perhaps not put the master and worker in the same file.\n  //\n  // It is also possible to get a bit fancier about logging, and\n  // implement whatever custom logic is needed to prevent DoS\n  // attacks and other bad behavior.\n  //\n  // See the options in the cluster documentation.\n  //\n  // The important thing is that the master does very little,\n  // increasing our resilience to unexpected errors.\n\n  cluster.fork();\n  cluster.fork();\n\n  cluster.on(&#39;disconnect&#39;, (worker) =&gt; {\n    console.error(&#39;disconnect!&#39;);\n    cluster.fork();\n  });\n\n} else {\n  // the worker\n  //\n  // This is where we put our bugs!\n\n  const domain = require(&#39;domain&#39;);\n\n  // See the cluster documentation for more details about using\n  // worker processes to serve requests.
