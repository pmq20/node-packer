The use of policies assumes\nsafe practices for the policy files such as ensuring that policy\nfiles cannot be overwritten by the Node.js application by using\nfile permissions.</p>\n<p>A best practice would be to ensure that the policy manifest is read only for\nthe running Node.js application, and that the file cannot be changed\nby the running Node.js application in any way. A typical setup would be to\ncreate the policy file as a different user id than the one running Node.js\nand granting read permissions to the user id running Node.js.</p>",
