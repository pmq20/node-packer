The interface is\ncareful to never buffer entire requests or responses--the\nuser is able to stream data.</p>\n<p>HTTP message headers are represented by an object like this:</p>\n<!-- eslint-skip -->\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">{ &#39;content-length&#39;: &#39;123&#39;,\n  &#39;content-type&#39;: &#39;text/plain&#39;,\n  &#39;connection&#39;: &#39;keep-alive&#39;,\n  &#39;host&#39;: &#39;mysite.com&#39;,\n  &#39;accept&#39;: &#39;*/*&#39; }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Keys are lowercased. Values are not modified.</p>\n<p>In order to support the full spectrum of possible HTTP applications, Node.js&#39;s\nHTTP API is very low-level.

It parses a message into headers and body but it does not\nparse the actual headers or the body.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"#http_message_headers\"><code>message.headers</code></a> for details on how duplicate headers are handled.</p>\n<p>The raw headers as they were received are retained in the <code>rawHeaders</code>\nproperty, which is an array of <code>[key, value, key2, value2, ...]</code>.

It maintains a queue of pending requests\nfor a given host and port, reusing a single socket connection for each\nuntil the queue is empty, at which time the socket is either destroyed\nor put into a pool where it is kept to be used again for requests to the\nsame host and port. Whether it is destroyed or pooled depends on the\n<code>keepAlive</code> <a href=\"#http_new_agent_options\">option</a>.</p>\n<p>Pooled connections have TCP Keep-Alive enabled for them, but servers may\nstill close idle connections, in which case they will be removed from the\npool and a new connection will be made when a new HTTP request is made for\nthat host and port. Servers may also refuse to allow multiple requests\nover the same connection, in which case the connection will have to be\nremade for every request and cannot be pooled. The <code>Agent</code> will still make\nthe requests to that server, but each one will occur over a new connection.</p>\n<p>When a connection is closed by the client or the server, it is removed\nfrom the pool. Any unused sockets in the pool will be unrefed so as not\nto keep the Node.js process running when there are no outstanding requests.\n(see <a href=\"net.html#net_socket_unref\">socket.unref()</a>).</p>\n<p>It is good practice, to <a href=\"#http_agent_destroy\"><code>destroy()</code></a> an <code>Agent</code> instance when it is no\nlonger in use, because unused sockets consume OS resources.</p>\n<p>Sockets are removed from an agent&#39;s pool when the socket emits either\na <code>&#39;close&#39;</code> event or an <code>&#39;agentRemove&#39;</code> event. When intending to keep one\nHTTP request open for a long time without keeping it in the pool, something\nlike the following may be done:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">http.get(options, (res) =&gt; {\n  // Do stuff\n}).on(&#39;socket&#39;, (socket) =&gt; {\n  socket.emit(&#39;agentRemove&#39;);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>An agent may also be used for an individual request. By providing\n<code>{agent: false}</code> as an option to the <code>http.get()</code> or <code>http.request()</code>\nfunctions, a one-time use <code>Agent</code> with default options will be used\nfor the client connection.</p>\n<p><code>agent:false</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">http.get({\n  hostname: &#39;localhost&#39;,\n  port: 80,\n  path: &#39;/&#39;,\n  agent: false  // create a new agent just for this one request\n}, (res) =&gt; {\n  // Do stuff with response\n});\n</code></pre>\n",

With <code>http.request()</code> one\nmust always call <code>req.end()</code> to signify the end of the request -\neven if there is no data being written to the request body.</p>\n<p>If any error is encountered during the request (be that with DNS resolution,\nTCP level errors, or actual HTTP parse errors) an <code>&#39;error&#39;</code> event is emitted\non the returned request object. As with all <code>&#39;error&#39;</code> events, if no listeners\nare registered the error will be thrown.</p>\n<p>There are a few special headers that should be noted.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Sending a &#39;Connection: keep-alive&#39; will notify Node.js that the connection to\nthe server should be persisted until the next request.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Sending a &#39;Content-Length&#39; header will disable the default chunked encoding.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Sending an &#39;Expect&#39; header will immediately send the request headers.\nUsually, when sending &#39;Expect: 100-continue&#39;, both a timeout and a listener\nfor the <code>continue</code> event should be set. See RFC2616 Section 8.2.3 for more\ninformation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Sending an Authorization header will override using the <code>auth</code> option\nto compute basic authentication.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example using a <a href=\"url.html#url_the_whatwg_url_api\"><code>URL</code></a> as <code>options</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">const { URL } = require(&#39;url&#39;);\n\nconst options = new URL(&#39;http://abc:xyz@example.com&#39;);\n\nconst req = http.request(options, (res) =&gt; {\n  // ...\n});\n</code></pre>\n"
