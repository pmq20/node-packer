There are two promises in the example above; the promise created by\n<code>Promise.resolve()</code> and the promise returned by the call to <code>then()</code>. In the\nexample above, the first promise got the <code>asyncId</code> <code>6</code> and the latter got\n<code>asyncId</code> <code>7</code>.
