The interface is\ncareful to never buffer entire requests or responses--the\nuser is able to stream data.</p>\n<p>HTTP message headers are represented by an object like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">{ &#39;content-length&#39;: &#39;123&#39;,\n  &#39;content-type&#39;: &#39;text/plain&#39;,\n  &#39;connection&#39;: &#39;keep-alive&#39;,\n  &#39;host&#39;: &#39;mysite.com&#39;,\n  &#39;accept&#39;: &#39;*/*&#39; }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Keys are lowercased. Values are not modified.</p>\n<p>In order to support the full spectrum of possible HTTP applications, Node.js&#39;s\nHTTP API is very low-level. It deals with stream handling and message\nparsing only. It parses a message into headers and body but it does not\nparse the actual headers or the body.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"#http_message_headers\"><code>message.headers</code></a> for details on how duplicate headers are handled.</p>\n<p>The raw headers as they were received are retained in the <code>rawHeaders</code>\nproperty, which is an array of <code>[key, value, key2, value2, ...]</code>.  For\nexample, the previous message header object might have a <code>rawHeaders</code>\nlist like the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">[ &#39;ConTent-Length&#39;, &#39;123456&#39;,\n  &#39;content-LENGTH&#39;, &#39;123&#39;,\n  &#39;content-type&#39;, &#39;text/plain&#39;,\n  &#39;CONNECTION&#39;, &#39;keep-alive&#39;,\n  &#39;Host&#39;, &#39;mysite.com&#39;,\n  &#39;accepT&#39;, &#39;*/*&#39; ]\n</code></pre>\n",

If no pending HTTP requests are waiting on a\nsocket to become free the socket is closed. This means that Node.js&#39;s\npool has the benefit of keep-alive when under load but still does not\nrequire developers to manually close the HTTP clients using\nKeepAlive.</p>\n<p>If you opt into using HTTP KeepAlive, you can create an Agent object\nwith that flag set to <code>true</code>.  (See the <a href=\"#http_new_agent_options\">constructor options</a>.)\nThen, the Agent will keep unused sockets in a pool for later use.  They\nwill be explicitly marked so as to not keep the Node.js process running.\nHowever, it is still a good idea to explicitly <a href=\"#http_agent_destroy\"><code>destroy()</code></a> KeepAlive\nagents when they are no longer in use, so that the Sockets will be shut\ndown.</p>\n<p>Sockets are removed from the agent&#39;s pool when the socket emits either\na <code>&#39;close&#39;</code> event or a special <code>&#39;agentRemove&#39;</code> event. This means that if\nyou intend to keep one HTTP request open for a long time and don&#39;t\nwant it to stay in the pool you can do something along the lines of:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">http.get(options, (res) =&gt; {\n  // Do stuff\n}).on(&#39;socket&#39;, (socket) =&gt; {\n  socket.emit(&#39;agentRemove&#39;);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatively, you could just opt out of pooling entirely using\n<code>agent:false</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">http.get({\n  hostname: &#39;localhost&#39;,\n  port: 80,\n  path: &#39;/&#39;,\n  agent: false  // create a new agent just for this one request\n}, (res) =&gt; {\n  // Do stuff with response\n});\n</code></pre>\n",

The\nheader is still mutable using the <code>setHeader(name, value)</code>, <code>getHeader(name)</code>,\n<code>removeHeader(name)</code> API.  The actual header will be sent along with the first\ndata chunk or when closing the connection.</p>\n<p>To get the response, add a listener for <a href=\"#http_event_response\"><code>&#39;response&#39;</code></a> to the request object.\n<a href=\"#http_event_response\"><code>&#39;response&#39;</code></a> will be emitted from the request object when the response\nheaders have been received.  The <a href=\"#http_event_response\"><code>&#39;response&#39;</code></a> event is executed with one\nargument which is an instance of <a href=\"#http_class_http_incomingmessage\"><code>http.IncomingMessage</code></a>.</p>\n<p>During the <a href=\"#http_event_response\"><code>&#39;response&#39;</code></a> event, one can add listeners to the\nresponse object; particularly to listen for the <code>&#39;data&#39;</code> event.</p>\n<p>If no <a href=\"#http_event_response\"><code>&#39;response&#39;</code></a> handler is added, then the response will be\nentirely discarded.  However, if you add a <a href=\"#http_event_response\"><code>&#39;response&#39;</code></a> event handler,\nthen you <strong>must</strong> consume the data from the response object, either by\ncalling <code>response.read()</code> whenever there is a <code>&#39;readable&#39;</code> event, or\nby adding a <code>&#39;data&#39;</code> handler, or by calling the <code>.resume()</code> method.\nUntil the data is consumed, the <code>&#39;end&#39;</code> event will not fire.  Also, until\nthe data is read it will consume memory that can eventually lead to a\n&#39;process out of memory&#39; error.</p>\n<p>Note: Node.js does not check whether Content-Length and the length of the body\nwhich has been transmitted are equal or not.</p>\n<p>The request implements the <a href=\"stream.html#stream_class_stream_writable\">Writable Stream</a> interface.
